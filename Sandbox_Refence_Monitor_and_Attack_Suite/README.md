# Sandbox Reference Monitor and Attack Suite

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive security framework consisting of a custom reference monitor for sandboxed Python program execution and a suite of attack case scripts designed to test and evaluate security mechanisms. The reference monitor intercepts system calls to enforce file operation policies within a controlled environment, while the attack suite demonstrates various techniques that could potentially bypass security controls.

**What it does:** The system creates a secure sandboxed environment where Python programs can only access authorized file operations through a reference monitor. The monitor enforces strict file handling policies and prevents unauthorized access to external OS-level and system-level resources.

**Why it's interesting:** This project demonstrates practical implementation of security-by-design principles, showcasing how to build robust reference monitors that can withstand sophisticated attack attempts. It provides hands-on experience with security frameworks, attack simulation, and defensive programming techniques.
