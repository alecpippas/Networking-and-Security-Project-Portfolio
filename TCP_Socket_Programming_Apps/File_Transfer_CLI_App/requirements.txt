# TCP File Transfer Application Requirements
# Core Python libraries used in this project

# Note: socket, socketserver, sys, and time are part of Python's standard library
# and do not need to be installed via pip. This file is included for
# project documentation and consistency with Python project standards.

# Python version requirement
# This project requires Python 2.7 (as provided on NYU's Vital virtual machines)
# for compatibility with the deployed environment

# No external dependencies required - all libraries used are part of Python's standard library:
# - socket: Low-level networking interface
# - socketserver: High-level network server framework  
# - sys: System-specific parameters and functions
# - time: Time utilities for timestamp generation

# If you plan to extend this project, consider adding:
# cryptography>=3.4.8  # For SSL/TLS encryption (Python 2.7 compatible version)
# threading  # For advanced concurrency (already in stdlib)
# hashlib  # For file integrity checks (already in stdlib)
# Note: asyncio is not available in Python 2.7
