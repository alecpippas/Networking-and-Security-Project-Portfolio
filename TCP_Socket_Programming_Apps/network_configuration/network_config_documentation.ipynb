    "This notebook documents the complete network setup for the virtual network used within TCP Socket Programming projects. The network consists of multiple routers (CN-R1, CN-R2, CN-R3, CN-R4) and hosts (KALI, Ubuntu) configured with IP addressing, OSPF routing, DNS resolution, and DHCP services.\n",

    "## Network Topology\n",
    "The virtual network is organized into multiple areas with the following key components:\n",
    "- **Area 0 (Backbone)**: Core routing area\n",
    "- **Area 1**: Network segment for server applications\n",
    "- **Area 2**: Network segment for client applications\n",
    "- **DHCP Server**: CN-R4 provides automatic IP address assignment\n",
    "- **DNS Servers**: Primary and secondary DNS for name resolution"
